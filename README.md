# Microservices with Docker, Flask, and React

## Following along with the free tutorial laid out at [testdriven.io](https://testdriven.io/part-one-intro)

I'm checking out this tutorial to enhance my knowledge of best practices for writing tested code in every aspect of an application. I hope to sharpen my abilities with TDD on the front end with React, learn more about Flask (Python server framework) and associated testing in that environment, and compose these services using Docker Compose.

### Edit - Lessons Learned:

* Microservices using docker are quick to spin up and seemingly powerful, but difficult to debug without a lot of knowledge of how each service needs to work.
* I need more practice with actual infra to understand the way the services need to interact and debug them.
* Test-driven development is fun, easy, and does half of the work of writing the actual functionality of an application.
